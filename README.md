This is a gameboy emulator written in typescript. Currently it plays most Gameboy games (a few have been tested to be working), as well as a few Gameboy color games, with some glitches. Sound is still not implemented. Games that are confirmed working:

- Megaman - Dr. Wiley's Revenge
- Tetris
- Dr. Mario
- Pokemon Red/Blue
- Donkey Kong
- Frogger
- Pokemon Gold/Silver (with some glitches)
- Zelda: Link's Awakening (DMG version)
- Pokemon Trading Card Game (with some graphical glitches)
- Super Mario Bros Deluxe

Sound is yet to be implemented. Emulator now passes all of Blargg's CPU and memory timing tests, as well as all of the cpu instruction tests. Emulator also passes CGB and DMG acid tests for graphics rendering.
